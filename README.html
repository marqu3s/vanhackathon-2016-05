<h2 id="answertothequestionsasked">Answer to the questions asked</h2>

<p>Q1. What was the hardest part?
R: Playing with socket.io library during the frontend challenge development. I&#8217;ve never used it so had to study it durting the hackathon.</p>

<p>Q2. If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
R: I think that the backend challenge went pretty good, but if I knew how hard it would be to do the
frontend challenge the way I tried to do it, I would advice myself to forget about it and focus just on the backend
to polish it to the maximum.</p>

<p>Q3. If you could change something about this challenge, what would it be?
R: I would probably team up with a frontend developer. I was affraid of doing it this time not because I don&#8217;t like to work as a team,
but because I was affraid to didn&#8217;t have time to finish my part on the project and harm the others on the team.</p>

<h2 id="abouttheproject">About the project</h2>

<p>This project uses a <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii 2</a> Advanced Project Template.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hosted at Github: https://github.com/marqu3s/vanhackathon&#8211;2016&#8211;05</p>

<p>There are 2 tiers:</p>

<ul>
<li>api - Code developed for challenge 1 (Mastermind game API)</li>
<li>frontend - Code developed for challenge 2 (A frontend consuming the API of challenge 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>Inside of these 2 folders the most important part of code are inside the subfolders: config, controllers, models, modules and views</p>

<p>The rest of the folders are mostly framework folders. Here is an overview of the project folder:</p>

<h2 id="setupinstructions">Setup Instructions</h2>

<p>This projects uses a MySQL database. The dump is included in the root folder - <code>database_mysql.sql</code></p>

<p>After importing the dump, adjust the <code>components['db']</code> configuration in <code>common/config/main.php</code> accordingly.</p>

<p>Install the composer depencies by running: <code>composer install</code> on the root folder.</p>

<p>Set document roots of your web server:</p>

<ul>
<li>for api <code>/path/to/project/api/web/</code> and using a local URL of your choice, like http://api.mastermind.dev/</li>
<li>for frontend <code>/path/to/project/frontend/web/</code> and using a local URL of your choice, like http://mastermind.dev/</li>
</ul>

<p>For Apache it could be the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
   ServerName mastermind.dev
   DocumentRoot &quot;/path/to/project/frontend/web/&quot;

   &lt;Directory &quot;/path/to/project/frontend/web/&quot;&gt;
       # use mod_rewrite for pretty URL support
       RewriteEngine on
       # If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
       RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
       RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
       # Otherwise forward the request to index.php
       RewriteRule . index.php

       # use index.php as index file
       DirectoryIndex index.php

       # ...other settings...
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
   ServerName api.mastermind.dev
   DocumentRoot &quot;/path/to/project/api/web/&quot;

   &lt;Directory &quot;/path/to/project/api/web/&quot;&gt;
       # use mod_rewrite for pretty URL support
       RewriteEngine on
       # If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
       RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
       RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
       # Otherwise forward the request to index.php
       RewriteRule . index.php

       # use index.php as index file
       DirectoryIndex index.php

       # ...other settings...
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

<p>Adjust the logs location to your needs.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget to change the hosts file to point the domain to your server.</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows: c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</li>
<li>Linux: /etc/hosts</li>
</ul>

<p>Add the following lines:</p>

<ul>
<li>127.0.0.1 mastermind.dev</li>
<li>127.0.0.1 api.mastermind.dev</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenge1:apiforplayingmastermindgame">Challenge 1: API for playing Mastermind Game</h2>

<p>The database and the API were built from the begining having multiplayer games in mind.</p>

<p>A documentation is available at Apiary so you can have an overview of its endpoints and supported requests: http://docs.joaomarquesmastermind.apiary.io</p>

<p>A DHC config file is also included on the root folder: <code>vanhackathon.json</code>. DHC is a Google Chrome Extension to test REST APIs.
You can install it and import the config file. It will create a project named <code>VanHackathon</code> with some API resquests examples used during the development.</p>

<h2 id="challenge2:afrontendforplayingmastermindgamewiththeapifromchallenge1">Challenge 2: A frontend for playing Mastermind Game with the API from challenge 1</h2>

<p>The real challenge here for me (as a developer, not a designer) is to don&#8217;t stress the server with so many requests.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I will try my best to build a client using websockets instead of firing a lot of ajax requests to the server.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not used to websockets but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for: LEARN NEW STUFF!</p>

<p>I decided to focus on making the websockets work. Maybe it will not look so good but hey, thats a designer job!
I know how to put thinks together with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap because those are the things I know but I&#8217; not that good in creating layouts.
I know how to bring one to life!</p>

<p>The result you can see by accessing the address http://mastermind.dev (or whatever you decided to use) on your browser.</p>

<p>UPDATE NEAR SUBMIT HOUR: I did not finished this challenge. I had a hard time with the websockets thing. But I was close.
It was a great experience anyway. I did a lot of resarch on this during the Hackathon and loose a precious time.
But I think the API is in pretty good shape and is very complete.</p>

<p>See you on the next Hackathon!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
